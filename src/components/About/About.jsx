              Hi! I'm Vaibhav, an aspiring innovator currently pursuing my B.Tech in **Computer Science (AI) at KIET Group of Institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the classroom, I'm a creative soul with a burning passion for discovery across **AI, SDET, and web development. My journey in technology is deeply intertwined with my love for exploring the unknownâ€”a personal quest to understand how things work and how they can be made better. I thrive on translating intricate challenges into intuitive, high-impact solutions that truly make a difference.
